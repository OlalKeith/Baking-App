# Baking App Project

This project is part of the Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

## App Description

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam,
to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and
see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and
implement apps where you are responsible for designing and
planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app.
Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide,
it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.
